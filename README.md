## Overview
This project presents a novel approach to health data analysis using **Federated Learning (FL)** to ensure **data confidentiality and collaboration**. Traditional healthcare data analysis requires centralized data collection, raising concerns about patient privacy and security. Our framework, **Confidential Collaborative Health Analysis**, enables **joint analysis of decentralized health data** while preserving privacy through secure FL techniques.

## Key Features
- **Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning**: Ensures that **raw patient data never leaves** individual institutions, reducing security risks.
- **Disease-Specific Feature Utilization**: Incorporates disease-related features for improved model accuracy and insights.
- **Collaborative AI Model Training**: Allows healthcare institutions to train models on local patient data **without sharing sensitive information**.
- **Robust Security Measures**: Protects against **Model Poisoning** and **Inference Attacks**, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Homomorphic Encryption & Differential Privacy**: Uses **secure federated averaging** and **differential privacy (Îµ = 0.5)** to enhance security.
- **High Model Accuracy**: Achieves **92% accuracy** on a real-world **chronic disease prediction dataset**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow Federated (TFF)**
- **PySyft**
- **Secure Aggregation Techniques**
- **Homomorphic Encryption**
- **Differential Privacy**

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/confidential-collaborative-health-analysis.git
   cd confidential-collaborative-health-analysis
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the federated training:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

## Results & Performance
- **Privacy-Preserving Analysis**: Enables secure health data analysis without centralized data collection.
- **Improved Model Performance**: Achieved **92% accuracy** on a chronic disease dataset.
- **Secure & Scalable**: Protects patient data while allowing healthcare institutions to collaborate efficiently.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)** for enhanced privacy.
- Extend framework to support **real-time federated learning**.
- Enhance defense mechanisms against **adversarial attacks**.
